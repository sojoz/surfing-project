            <h3>Why Surfing?</h3>
            <h2>Surfing is not just a hobby - it's a lifestyle</h2>
            <p>
              Surfers only ride a wave for an average time of six seconds, and
              the waves of their lives only arrive from time to time. But in
              this sport, it's rare to meet someone who quit surfing because
              they didn't enjoy the feeling of walking on the water. Surfers
              have more fair surf sessions on average than they do epic moments
              in crystal clear waves. The best rides of their lives come along
              only once in a while. So, despite onshore surfing days, one-foot
              waves, cold water, and choppy waters, surfers always return to the
              scene of the crime. Why is surfing so addictive? Is it any
              different from other sports, such as soccer, running, swimming, or
              tennis? Surfing is highly addictive. It is one of the most popular
              board sports ever invented. There are over 20 million surfers in
              the world, and the number is growing fast.

            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
              My name is Josephine and I am an avid beginner surfer. Why is
              surfing good for the soul? There is a sense of freedom that comes
              with it a rush when you take the wave. Also, it's good exercise!
