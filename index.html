            <h3>Why Surfing?</h3>
            <h2>Surfing is not just a hobby - it's a lifestyle</h2>
            <p>
              Surfers only ride a wave for an average time of six seconds, and
              the waves of their lives only arrive from time to time. But in
              this sport, it's rare to meet someone who quit surfing because
              they didn't enjoy the feeling of walking on the water. Surfers
              have more fair surf sessions on average than they do epic moments
              in crystal clear waves. The best rides of their lives come along
              only once in a while. So, despite onshore surfing days, one-foot
              waves, cold water, and choppy waters, surfers always return to the
              scene of the crime. <br />
              <br />
              Why is surfing so addictive? Is it any different from other
              sports, such as soccer, running, swimming, or tennis? Surfing is
              highly addictive. It is one of the most popular board sports ever
              invented. There are over 20 million surfers in the world, and the
              number is growing fast. Surfing is addicting because of the
              stimuli your brain experiences, the community you become part of
              and the philosophy behind the sport. The combination of these
              things makes surfing not only fun but leaves you wanting more
              after every session.

                  Essaouiraâ€™s coastal city offers some of the best surfing
                  conditions in Morocco. The waves are consistent and the water
                  temperature is pleasant year-round, making it an ideal spot

              My name is Josephine and I am an avid beginner surfer. Why is
              surfing good for the soul? There is a sense of freedom that comes
              with it a rush when you take the wave. Also, it's good exercise!
